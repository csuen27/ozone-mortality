# Tutorial Codes
Here we share some demonstrative and tutorial codes which were used to accomplilsh our research on ozone-exposure-associated mortality. 

The research questions are: i) how ambient ozone change with space and time over the past 30 years, 1990-2019, ii) how urban and rural populations are exposed to different levels of ozone pollution, and iii) how manu premature deaths are caused from long-term ozone exposure. 

The codes are classified into 3 categories, as listed below: 
Analysis: 
A1-1 Mortality estimation by curved risk model 
A2-1 Change rate decomposition: Mortality 1990
A2-2 Change rate decomposition: Population growth 
A2-3 Change rate decomposition: Population ageing
A2-4 Change rate decomposition: Baseline mortality change
A2-5 Change rate decomposition: Exposure increasing
