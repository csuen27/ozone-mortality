# Tutorial Codes
Here we share some demonstrative and tutorial codes which were used to accomplilsh our research on ozone-exposure-associated mortality. 

The research questions are: i) how ambient ozone change with space and time over the past 30 years, 1990-2019, ii) how urban and rural populations are exposed to different levels of ozone pollution, and iii) how manu premature deaths are caused from long-term ozone exposure. 

The codes are classified into 3 categories, as listed below:   
Analysis:   
A1-1 Mortality estimation by curved risk model   
A2-1 Change rate decomposition: Mortality 1990  
A2-2 Change rate decomposition: Population growth   
A2-3 Change rate decomposition: Population ageing  
A2-4 Change rate decomposition: Baseline mortality change  
A2-5 Change rate decomposition: Exposure increasing  
A2-6 Change rate decomposition: Urbanisation migration  
A2-7 Change rate decomposition: Summing up   
  
Tutorial:   
T1-1 Meta-analysis  
T2-1 Mortality estimation by curved risk model   
T2-2 Mortality estimation by linear risk model
